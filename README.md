A program is designed to ascertain whether a given number "n" qualifies as a happy number or not. Utilizing the Functional Interface approach:

A positive number is provided within the range 1<=n.
Each digit is squared, and the sum of the squared digits is calculated.
This process is iterated until a single-digit number is obtained. If that number equals 1, it is recognized as a happy number.
